# About

This REST API, built in Django, has been written to complement [Auto Readme](https://github.com/ArunSahadeo/auto-readme).

It is still in-progress, but was inspired by the [Dash for macOS](https://kapeli.com/dash) project, and like Dash, it provides access to documentation for libraries indexed by the API.
